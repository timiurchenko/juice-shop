# Snyk (https://snyk.io) policy file

exclude:
# Use either “global” or “code”. “global” currently applies only to the Snyk Code product, and it will exclude the specified directories and files from these tests; “code” applies only to the Snyk Code analysis.

    global:
        # Exclude a single file. For example, - test.spec.js
            #- file_name.ext
        # Exclude a single directory. For example, - src/lib
            #- source/directory_name
        # Exclude any file with a specific extension in the specific directory. For example, - tests/.js
            #- directory_name/.ext
        # Exclude files with a specific ending in any directory. For example, - “/.spec.js”
            #- "/.ending.ext"
        # Exclude files in directories that have the same name with a different ending, like “test” and “tests”. The last character before the question mark is optional. For example, - tests?/
            - "routes*/**"
        # Exclude all files and directories in a specific directory. For example, - tests/
            #- directory_name/**
